# Nivlak

Turborepo monorepo, pnpm workspaces. Next.js 16 marketing site + Express/tRPC
API, MongoDB via Prisma, Better-Auth. Scaffolded by Better-T-Stack (`bts.jsonc`
records the exact generator invocation).

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | Next.js 16 App Router site. The landing page is the whole reason this repo is interesting — see below. |
| `apps/server` | Express host for the tRPC router. Thin; the logic is in `packages/api`. |
| `packages/api` | tRPC routers + request context. |
| `packages/auth` | Better-Auth configuration. |
| `packages/db` | Prisma client and schema. Owns all `db:*` scripts. |
| `packages/env` | Zod-validated env, split `server.ts` / `web.ts`. Imported for side effects (`import "@nivlak/env/web"` at the top of `next.config.ts`) so a missing var fails the build, not a request. |
| `packages/ui` | Shared shadcn/ui primitives and design tokens. |
| `packages/infra` | Alchemy IaC for the Cloudflare deploy. |
| `tools/` | Frame-pipeline and QA scripts for the landing page. |

## Commands

Run from the repo root; turbo filters to the right workspace.

```bash
pnpm dev              # web (:3001) + server (:3000)
pnpm dev:web          # web only
pnpm build
pnpm check-types      # tsc across every workspace
pnpm db:push          # prisma db push
pnpm db:studio
pnpm deploy           # alchemy deploy (Cloudflare)
```

There is no lint task and no test suite. `pnpm check-types` and a build are the
only automated gates — which is why the landing page has a screenshot harness
(below), because neither of them can see it.

## Deploy: two paths, and they disagree

Both are wired up and they are not the same target.

- **Cloudflare** — the one `bts.jsonc` and `packages/infra` describe.
  `@opennextjs/cloudflare` + `wrangler.jsonc` + `alchemy.run.ts`; `pnpm deploy`.
- **Netlify** — `netlify.toml` at the root, added later, builds
  `pnpm --filter web build` and publishes `apps/web/.next` via
  `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`.

Before touching build config, find out which one is actually serving
production. Changing `next.config.ts` or the output mode affects both.

## The landing page

`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` is two pinned sections and nothing else. No header,
no footer, no panels.

```
<BookScrollReveal />   01  navy book opens, 91-frame canvas scrub   +=400%
<BookPages />          02-07  six sheets turn over the open spread  +=450%
```

### Files, in the order to read them

1. **`book-camera.ts`** — pure arithmetic, no DOM. This is where the reveal is
   *designed*; everything else paints what it returns. Read it first.
   - `planAt(u, w, h)` → what to draw at scroll progress `u`.
   - `spreadAt(w, h)` / `finalFrameRect(w, h)` → where the open book's halves
     land on screen, for anything that sits **on** the book rather than in it.
2. **`book-frames.generated.ts`** — generated, never hand-edit. Frame count,
   dimensions, letterbox colour, and a measured per-frame bounding box of the
   book so the pan follows the real footage instead of a guess.
3. **`book-scroll-reveal.tsx`** — owns the canvas, the frame cache and the
   first ScrollTrigger.
4. **`book-pages.tsx`** — owns the six turning sheets and the second one.
5. **`book-pages.content.ts`** — the six sections' copy. Currently placeholder.

### Rules that are not obvious from the code

- **Geometry comes from the camera, never from CSS.** Sheets sit on the real
  gutter because `spreadAt()` runs the same arithmetic the painter runs. A
  hardcoded `50%` will drift apart from the photograph on resize.
- **`FRAME_SET` is part of the URL for a reason.** Frames are served
  `immutable, max-age=31536000` (`next.config.ts`). A rebuilt set reuses the
  same filenames, so it must go in a **new** `/frames/<set>/` directory or
  every returning visitor keeps the old book for a year.
- **Pass `revertOnUpdate: true` to `useGSAP` when it has dependencies.** It
  runs your cleanup on a dependency change but does not revert the context, so
  a pinned ScrollTrigger leaves its spacing on the document and any `gsap.set`
  inline styles stay put. A manual `kill(true)` covers the spacing only.
- **Do not set `refreshPriority` on these triggers.** It sorts the opposite way
  to the intuition (higher refreshes first), and page order is already the
  default via `_sortY`. Setting it broke the reveal's scroll length.
- **Under a scrub, prefer `ease: "none"`.** An eased tween spends most of its
  motion in the middle of its duration, so the interesting part of a turn goes
  past in a couple of hundred pixels of wheel. The scrub's own catch-up is the
  weight an ease would have added.
- **Redraw on ScrollTrigger's `refresh`, not on `resize`.** While pinned, GSAP
  writes explicit pixel dimensions onto the section, so a resize handler reads
  the stale pinned size.
- **Portrait phones take a different path.** The 16:9 frame crops to a tall
  band and the spine lands two thirds across, leaving the right-hand page mostly
  off-screen. `layout()` falls back to a full-bleed sheet hinged at the
  viewport edge.

### Rebuilding the frames

`tools/build-book-frames.sh` decodes `nivlak-book-opening.mp4` (not in the repo)
into two tiers plus the measured camera track. `tools/stamp-book-logo.py`
replaces the approximated logo on the cover in the encoded webps; it is not
idempotent — `git checkout apps/web/public/frames/v4` before a second run. Both
scripts carry long headers explaining the decisions and the measurements behind
them. Read those before changing either.

## Verifying scroll work

**Use the `scroll-reveal-qa` skill** (`.claude/skills/scroll-reveal-qa/`) for any
change to the reveal, the pages, the camera, the frame set, or any pin/scrub
timing. It drives `tools/scroll-shots.mjs`, which screenshots the running dev
server at real scroll positions and can dump live DOM state at a scroll offset.

A build log is not evidence about this page. Every bug it has had — a fallback
firing on the wrong viewports, doubled pin spacing, type printed over type —
compiled and typechecked cleanly and was obvious in a screenshot.

## Conventions

- Comments explain **why**, with the measurement that settled it. The existing
  comments in `book-camera.ts`, `build-book-frames.sh` and `next.config.ts` are
  the house style: they name the alternative that was rejected and the number
  that rejected it. Match that density; do not narrate what the code says.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` is written and re-added by `next dev`. Commit it with
  your work rather than reverting it — removing it only re-creates the change.
- Next.js 16 differs from older versions in APIs and conventions. Check
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolve from `apps/web`, not the repo root)
  rather than assuming.
- Shared UI goes in `packages/ui`, not `apps/web/src/components`. Design tokens
  live in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
